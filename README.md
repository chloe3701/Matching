# Matching
Bipartite matching problem in different settings.

Utils:
Contains the graph structure and the code to generate random scenarios

Online:
Contains the implementation of the water-filling algorithm and its comparison to the optimal solution.

Learning_augmented:
Contains the implementation of the Primal-Dual algorithm to solve the Bipartite matching (using Hungarian algorithm)
it also contains its learning augmented variant as well as the performance comparison
Here we're looking for the minimum weight matching
